      '''The Doe-Eyed Damsel appears when we struggle to take responsibility for ourselves and life. These are moments when you feel that life is overwhelming and frustrating. The feeling of “I can’t” “Please save me” or “Do it for me, so I don’t have to.”. Feeling helpless and sorry for yourself. It’s an immature energy. The energy of an entitled princess who wants all the nice things in life, but doesn’t want to have to take responsibility for making it happen and instead feels resentful at life and others. The damsel doesn’t want a solution, she just wants it fixed for her. Her Prince Charming coming to the rescue. Whether it’s an actual man, money or something else, she just wants to be rescued so that she doesn’t have to take responsibility herself. 

The Hard-Shelled Woman is birthed out of the need to feel safe. She is strong, tough and hard. As the hard woman, you may even be perceived as empowered by the world. But you know better. You know that deep down there is an insecure little girl, longing for love and safety. This is because you know that this is just a protective shell. You have created layers of protection around yourself and around your heart. You don’t believe that you can be soft and feminine. Maybe you even see vulnerability and tenderness as a weakness. You keep people at bay and protect yourself. Yes, you may feel safe. But you also feel so lonely, tired and disconnected.

The People-Pleasing Good-Girl appears when you want to get something – love, approval, belonging. She wants to be liked by everyone and so she doesn’t know how to say no. As the people-pleaser or the good-girl, you don’t want to disappoint or let people down. But what is the price? You have no energy left for yourself. And who takes care of you? You mother people, try to fix and help and you give, give, give. Even when there is nothing left to give. To you, self-care is selfish, AND you put others and the world ahead of yourself. You end up feeling exhausted, depleted and drained. And still you don’t have what you desire or deserve.''';

      '''I think how I ended up living on one of the most famous Balearic Islands in Spain, is one of the most soul-led stories that I have to share.
      
It all started years ago when in 2014 I met who I felt to be the love of my life through our work online, he was someone I almost immediately recognized as my twin soul. There was a lot of back and forth in which we even spent almost two Heavenly weeks together in 2015 in India where he was born and raised. In the end, however, he could not shake the conditioning of his culture and ultimately chose the arranged marriage his family wanted for him.
      
Because he felt he needed to do what his family and culture expected of him, he banished me from his life in 2016 and pretty much cut off all contact, although energetically we remained deeply connected. In late January 2017, I dreamed that he came to make love to me, after which he held me in his arms and told me that he was getting married but that he would love me forever.
      
Two days later I woke up to a rainfall of messages from my team members who had seen pictures online of him preparing for his wedding. When I asked, one of his mates confirmed that he was getting married that day. His friend had not told me before because he didn’t want to be the one to hurt me. Actually, none of his friends wanted to be the one to tell me, so no one did.
      
Because I had already had a year to grieve the loss of this relationship, it wasn’t that difficult to accept his marriage. And after two months I asked myself an important question; ‘What do I want to do with the rest of my life now that my dream of being together happily ever after had gone up in smoke?’
      
‘What does my soul want to create now?’
      
I heard a voice inside me whisper ‘You always wanted to live by the sea. Go to Ibiza! The funny thing was that I had never been to Ibiza, I had only heard of it. I had never been to Spain at all. But because I felt so strongly that this was where I needed to be, I started to research the island.
      
By the end of that month, during a Tony Robbins event in London I spoke to the man in India again, out of the blue he took my call during a break at the event. We hadn’t spoken to each other since 2016. I told him of my plans to move to Ibiza and he said ‘You know what I love the most about you is that when you decide something you make it happen.’ In that phone conversation, he also promised me that even though he didn’t know if he would ever leave his wife that if he did, he would be on a plane to me the very next day. He had been married exactly three months that day.
      
After this conversation, I had to make Ibiza happen of course, but he was right – it is in my nature to be someone that does what they set their mind to do. This was something he felt incapable of because he had been so conditioned to do what pleases others and sacrifice his own needs and desires in the process. So, by June 2017, I hopped on a plane with my youngest kid and my mom off for a weekend in Ibiza just to get a feel for the island. Because I didn’t know the island we ended up in a hotel in San Antonio and I hated it. If you want to see Ibiza at its worst, this is it with loads of drunken tourists and crazy hen parties (bachelorette) filled with gin and throwing hoops on a strapped-on dildo on the bride-to-be’s head. I am not joking.
      
The first night I spent throwing up and crying. Here I was following the voice of my heart and it was horrible there. I really felt led astray by my soul and guides at that moment. The next day we rented a car and drove to other parts of the island that suited us much better and I fell in love with Ibiza. Especially as I walked up the steps of the Castillo de Dalt Vila I heard a happy voice inside me singing ‘I’m home. I’m home….’s''';

With a background in IT where Sabriyé used to write user manuals for complex computer systems, she has a unique skill for creating easy to understand step by step user protocols.

  static const String sabriyePurposeInAboutContent3 =
      '''The teachings Sabriyé shares concentrate on the fact that the Inner Union or Ascension process is meant to trigger unprocessed collective, personal, and ancestral trauma to help “the self” return to its original state of wholeness. It is through healing these deep subconscious wounds that we recover our true self and prepare the physical body to hold the higher vibrational frequency of the soul, creating as above, so below.

She teaches that until we address this trauma from the past, the subconscious mind attempts to help us heal the unprocessed pain of these experiences by pulling in the people, situations, and experiences that help us re-create the unresolved pain of the original wound, in order to be able to release these often long stuck emotions once and for all.

Because 95% of our reality is created by the subconscious mind, when we carry unresolved pain and trauma in our energy field, this is what we will see reflected back to us in our external reality. Our outer reality is always a reflection of what is going on inside of us, this remains true whether it is created from the wounded ego (fear) or the soul (love) – as within, so without.

The reason why so many people have tried everything else to manifest the life of their dreams but failed is because their ego and soul were not on the same page.''';
